Some of these maps were made with fiducial cuts applied
to the simulated and accepted data. We have found that 
this makes for poor maps. So we have redone some maps
that do not have fiducial cuts applied. The files that
have been replaced are:

I have kept the original maps and saved them in the
oldMaps directory. All other maps not mentioned still
have the old bug.
